# [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice)

# Give it some personality
This project was created by me, Lucas.
Its pretty simple, but I added some of my favorite techs and conventions,
like Typescript, Yarn, Eslint and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
This last one is cool and you may never heard about it.

# If you want to fork it
To get started you will need:
Node 10+ 
Yarn or NPM

To build the project you can run:
```yarn```
```yarn build``` or ```yarn watch``` to watch for file changes

To run it:
```yarn start``` or ```yarn dev``` to watch changes

# Thank you
